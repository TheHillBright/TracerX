Tracer-X Next-Generation Symbolic Execution
===========================================

Introduction
------------
Symbolic execution is a technique for finding software defects automatically. It is effective in generating traceable defect reports. In this project we build upon our experience with TRACER symbolic execution tool to advance further by combining the technologies we have developed with advanced symbolic execution approaches.

The Team
--------
The project is led by [Joxan Jaffar](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~joxan/). Other team members (in alphabetical order) are: [Chu Duc Hiep](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~chuduchi/), [Felicia Halim](https://github.com/feliciahalim), [Rasool Maghareh](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~rasool/), [Nguyen Duc Than](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~nguyendt/), [guyen Quoc Binh](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~nqbinh/), [Andrew Santosa](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~andrews/), and [Minh-Thai Trinh](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~trinhmt/).

Resources
---------
- The [Tracer-X](https://github.com/feliciahalim/klee) early prototype is based on [KLEE](https://github.com/klee/klee). It is still being actively developed by the team and not yet ready for release. Needless to say, we do not have resources to provide technical support. There are several [example programs](https://github.com/feliciahalim/klee-examples) that we use for testing it.
- An [internal project wiki](http://paella.ddns.comp.nus.edu.sg/trac) is available for team members.
